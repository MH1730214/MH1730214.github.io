Hello! I am MH.
I like Warhammer my favorite Age of Sigmar. I like the Stormcast most. If you like that I'm always looking for friends who like Warhammer.


What I want to be is a historian. I choose this because it makes a great amount of money and I just absolutely love learning about history. This connects to my life goals because it will let me learn of all the history that I want. It will also help me get money to live comfortably with a family. Skills from computer science will help me because you have to analyze code like you do with history so I will get better at analyzing code which will get me better at analyzing the past and figuring things out that happened.
